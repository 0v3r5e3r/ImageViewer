# ImageViewer
 A simple java app to view images. Custom PNG decoder. NOT FOR ACTUAL USE.


I actually created this because I was mad at Window's Photo app. The thing is so slow and I just hate it.
This likely will not get many updates. I may make the PNG decoder fully compliant one day if I'm bored.

Yes I know ImageIO exists, I wanted to make my own decoder. Yes I know it's not efficient.
